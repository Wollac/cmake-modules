cmake-modules
=============

This is a collection of CMake modules that I've written for some software
developement in the area of combinatorial optimzation and integer programming.

How to use
==========

Tell CMake where the modules are located by adding the following line to your
root CMakeLists.txt file:

    list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")
  
All the modules for find_package check for corresponding PKG_ROOT CMake or
environment variable. If it is set, the module prefers this location.
